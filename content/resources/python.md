Any resources below that I have done a more thorough review, I will link to the
posts.

## [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

If you don't know much about Python or would like to get a good foundation,
reading Al's books can be a great start.
I have read Automate the Boring Stuff and it helped me early on to get Python to
help me with my job.
My initial program was using a Raspberry Pi to control relays to have 
discharge batteries.
My next project at work I was able to convert HEX logs and convert to a human
readable format.
These initial projects I was able to do using Al's books.

## [Beyond the Boring Stuff](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/)

This is a nice continuation from Automate the Boring Stuff.
Al does a nice job going through and talking about the tools to help make
coding easier.
He also goes through how to progress on your Python journey.

## [Practical Business Python](https://pbpython.com/)

I have found that Chris' articles have been very helpful in using Python for my
job.
I highly recommend signing up for the newsletter or using RSS.
His articles helped me improve my skills using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to
do data analysis and present that data to the rest of my team.

## [Python Testing with pytest](https://pragprog.com/titles/bopytest2/python-testing-with-pytest-second-edition/)

This book as of June 2023 I have not completed.
Testing my code has not been my most favorite activity.
Going through Brian's book has made me appreciate how easy it can be to test
using pytest.
Most of the issues I had with testing my code was that my code structure wasn't
great.
I hop going through this book will improve me code coverage and my confidence
that my code is working as I intended but also improve my writing of code as
well.

## [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

A great resource to get information through tutorials and training.
Very helpful to narrow down which Python packages to use or to get a good
overview over programming concepts.
I have purchased a couple of training courses which was beyond the beginner
level training.

## [Reuven Lerner](https://store.lerner.co.il/)

So far I have taken his Python courses but I also his Practice Makes Regexp and
his [Pandas Workout](https://www.manning.com/books/pandas-workout) books.
I did a review on
[Object-Orient Python]({filename}/python/2022-01-08-reuven_oop.md)
and [Weekly Python Exercise A3]({filename}/python/2022-01-14-reuven_wpe.md).

## [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/)

Initially found Michael's website by listening to his podcasts.
I have brought multiple of his training courses which has helped round out my
Python knowledge.

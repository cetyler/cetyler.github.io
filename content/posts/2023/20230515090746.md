**Note** that this will only work with Python 3.10 and above.

## The *match case* Statement in Python

A basic implementation of `match case` statements looks like an `if` statement
in Python.

```python
>>> command = 'Hello, World!'
>>> match command:
...     case 'Hello, World!':
...         print('Hello to you too!')
...     case 'Goodbye, World!':
...         print('See you later')
...     case other:
...         print('No match found')

Hello to you too!
```

It can simplify the flow control statements and make them a little bit more
readable.

```python
>>> def file_handler_v2(command):
...     match command.split():
...         case ['show']:
...             print('List all files and directories: ')
...             # code to list files
...         case ['remove' | 'delete', *files] if '--ask' in files:
...             del_files = [f for f in files if len(f.split('.'))>1]
...             print('Please confirm: Removing files: {}'.format(del_files))
...             # code to accept user input, then remove files
...         case ['remove' | 'delete', *files]:
...             print('Removing files: {}'.format(files))
...             # code to remove files
...         case _:
...             print('Command not recognized')
```

This is easier than a `if-elif-else` or using something like a `dict()`.

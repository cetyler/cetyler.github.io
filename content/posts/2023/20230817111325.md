I needed to see the code of a stored procedure in MS SQL Server at work so that
I could create a modified query.
I normally don't use
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8733088/how-to-view-the-stored-procedure-code-in-sql-server-management-studio)
much anymore but this was actually useful and well described.

Using SQL Server Management Studio do the following:

* Go to Database -> Programmmability -> Stored Procedure.
* Right click on the procedure you want to view and click **Modify**.
* Be careful not to modify it when you only want to view it.

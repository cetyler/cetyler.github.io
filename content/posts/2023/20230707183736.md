I am not sure who I saw this on Mastodon but it was something that is quick and
easy to check.
Use the following:

```bash
select conrelid::regclass
      ,conname
  from pg_constraint
 where not convalidated
```

Nothing should be returned but if there is you know if a constraint was created
without validation.

The find utility on Linux allows you to pass in a bunch of interesting
arguments, including one to execute another command on each file.
Weâ€™ll use this in order to figure out what files are older than a certain
number of days, and then use the rm command to delete them.

## Command Syntax

```bash
find /path/to/files* -mtime +5 -exec rm {} \;
```

Note that there are spaces between `rm`, `{}`, and `\;`.

## Explanation

The first argument is the path to the files.
This can be a path, a directory, or a wildcard as in the example above.
I would recommend using the full path, and make sure that you run the command
without the exec rm to make sure you are getting the right results.

The second argument, `-mtime`, is used to specify the number of days old that
the file is. If you enter +5, it will find files older than 5 days.

The third argument, `-exec`, allows you to pass in a command such as `rm`.
The `{} \;` at the end is required to end the command.

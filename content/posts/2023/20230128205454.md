From Dimitri's [The Art of PostgreSQL](https://theartofpostgresql.com/).
PostgreSQL has an `application_name` parameter, which you can set in the
connection string.
It is then possible have it reported in the server's logs and is also part of
the system `pg_stat_activity`.

For example:

```bash
"postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/db_name?application_name=app_name"
```

## Overview

Will take awhile to rebuild my website as my plan is not to have all the same
posts that I had before.

## Setup

Still will use GitHub pages except I am using GitHub Actions to build these pages.
Using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and since I use Ubuntu, just using the offical
snap.
I am initially using [Hextra theme](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) as it
supports light and dark modes.
I just blew out my old git repository that I used
[Pelican](https://getpelican.com) since I had a `pelican` branch that had the
source code and `master` which the static HTML pages resided.

## Initial Structure

Will keep it simple and have the following pages:

- Posts
- About page
- Resume

## Next Steps

I will like to add the ability to search and will slowly add some of my previous
articles/posts.
I still need to learn how to do things in Hugo but I don't think it is going to
be too difficult.

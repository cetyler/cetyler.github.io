I saw this from [Tucker's](https://blog.dusktreader.dev/2025/03/29/self-contained-python-scripts-with-uv/)
and [Dave's](https://thisdavej.com/share-python-scripts-like-a-pro-uv-and-pep-723-for-easy-deployment/) 
articles.
Basically you can create a Python script, include what are the required dependencies and using `uv`, be able
to run the script and get the dependencies all in one go.

To add a dependency to a script you can do the following:

```bash
> uv add --script your_script.py httpx
```

This will include `httpx` as a dependency:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.13"
# dependencies = [
#     "httpx",
# ]
# ///

import argparse
import asyncio
```

To run this script:

```bash
> uv run your_script.py
```

Also if you put the following on the first line in the script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
...
```
or
```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
...
```

Now the script can be executable (`chmod +x your_script.py`).
**Note** won't work in PowerShell but should work in Unix-like systems.
However this could work with the `py` launcher if you do the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
...
```

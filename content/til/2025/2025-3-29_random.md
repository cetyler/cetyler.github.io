Another tip from [Haki Benita](https://hakibenita.com/sql-for-data-analysis).
While it is possible to do this in say Python, it can be useful to do everything
in SQL.

## Random

To generate random numbers PostgreSQL provides a random function that returns a 
value between 0 and 1:

```sql
SELECT random();
0.5917508391168769
```

To generate values at different ranges you can random in an expression: 

```sql
-- Random float between 0 and 100
SELECT random() * 100;
59.17508391168769

-- Random integer between 1 and 100
SELECT ceil(random() * 100);
59

-- Random integer between 11 and 100
SELECT 10 + ceil(random() * 90);
59
```

It's a common mistake to use round instead of ceil or floor to generate a range 
of integers. 
Using round may produce inconsistent distribution. 
Consider the following query to generate random integers in the range 0 - 4 
using round instead ceil: 

```sql
SELECT
round(random() * 3) AS n,
count(*)
FROM
generate_series(0, 1000)
GROUP BY
1;

n │ count
──┼───────
0 │   150
1 │   328
2 │   341
3 │   182
```

Notice how the values 0 and 3 are coming up less than 1 and 2. 
Using round, random values less than 0.5 will be rounded down to 0, and random 
numbers greater than 2.5 will be rounded up to 3, while for example, random 
values between 0.5 and 1.5 will be rounded to 1. 
This makes the edges less likely to come up.

This problem can be solved by either rounding up or down. 
Consider the same query using ceil: 

```sql
SELECT
ceil(random() * 3) AS n,
count(*)
FROM
generate_series(0, 1000)
GROUP BY
1;

n │ count
──┼───────
1 │   328
2 │   339
3 │   334
```

Using ceil produces more evenly distributed random numbers.

## Random Choice

You can use the random function to pick a random value from a list of values: 

```sql
SELECT
(array['red', 'green', 'blue'])[ceil(random() * 3)] AS color
FROM
generate_series(1, 5);

color
───────
green
green
blue
green
blue
```
     
The expression defines an array of colors, and then uses random to get a random 
element from the array. 
Notice that in PostgreSQL, arrays start at 1: 

```sql
    -- In PostgreSQL arrays start at 1
    SELECT (array['red', 'green', 'blue'])[1];

     array
    ───────
     red
```

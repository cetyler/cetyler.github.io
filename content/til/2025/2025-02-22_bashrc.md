Found this at [Bite Code](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/slashing-my-bashrc-in-half)
where [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/) could be a good history replacement.
According to the article Atuin meant all my tabs history was synced, unlimited
and easy to search.
No more hacky plugin, no more playing with HISTCONTROL, HISTSIZE, or HISTFILESIZE.
No need to move to zsh (although it is compatible with it).

One of
[Simon Willison's TIL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/7/uv-python-reinstall/)
showed that it is easy enough to upgrade Python with `uv`:

```bash
$ uv python install --reinstall 3.13
```

However this could break your existing virtual environments so instead:

```bash
$ uv python install 3.13.X
```

Which won't get rid of the previous version.

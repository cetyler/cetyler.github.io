[Mike's article](https://www.pythonpapers.com/p/finding-differences-in-images-with)
about using [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to find differences in
images.

In his example, you could output the difference using a simple function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageChops

def diff(image_path_one, image_path_two, output_path):
    image_one = Image.open(image_path_one)
    image_two = Image.open(image_path_two)
    image_three = ImageChops.difference(image_one, image_two)
    image_three.save(output_path)

if __name__ = "__main__":
    diff("yellow_butterfly.jpg","watermarked_butterfly.jpg")
```

I can see how this could be useful to do a compare of a given picture like what Mike did
or take a image of a chart and compare the differences as well.

[Ami's article](https://amivora.substack.com/p/an-introverts-3-secrets-to-networking)
about how to network when you are more of an introvert is a good reminder for me.
I need to definitely do this more:

1. Use common work tasks like recruiting to build relationships.
2. Set “talk with new people” goals for myself.
3. Excuse myself gracefully from conversations. 

I need to also use some of the tools in LinkedIn as well.

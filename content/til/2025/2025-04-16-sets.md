Saw this tip from [Trey Hunner's newsletter](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/).


Do you need to de-duplicate items in a list?
```python
>>> my_items = ["duck", "mouse", "duck", "computer"]
```
If you don't care about maintaining the order of your items, you could use the built-in set constructor:
```python
>>> unique_items = set(my_items)
>>> unique_items
{'computer', 'mouse', 'duck'}
```
If you do care about maintaining the order of your items, you could use the `dict` class's `fromkeys` method along with the built-in list constructor:
```python
>>> unique_items = list(dict.fromkeys(my_items))
>>> unique_items
['duck', 'mouse', 'computer']
```
Note that those two techniques only work for numbers, strings, or other hashable objects.

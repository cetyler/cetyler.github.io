If you are using the string form you need to URL escape the options argument:

```python
postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database_name?options=-csearch_path%3Ddbo,public
```

This will connect to `localhost` to database `database_name` with `public`
schema.
This can be useful to include the schema to reduce adding the schema to each
query.
For my use case, I am going through
[The Art of PostgreSQL](https://theartofpostgresql.com/) and I want to put the
training data in a schema `taop`.
Instead of updating each Python file for each query, I can just update the
connection string.

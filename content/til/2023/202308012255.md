I don't recall where I saw this, but in PostgreSQL, you can set a statement
timeout to potentially prevent problems with a long running query running.

```sql
$ alter database mydatabase set statement_timeout = '60s';
```

Another thing you may want to set is `idle_in_transaction` timeout as well
which will cancel long running transaction that are no longer performing work.

There is more information in PostgreSQL
[documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html).

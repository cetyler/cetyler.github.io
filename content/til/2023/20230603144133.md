## Use cat and find

The “cat” and “find” commands also help find details about your battery and power source.

Syntax

For the battery capacity, the syntax would be:
```bash
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity
```
For more detailed battery information use the find command.

Syntax

And the syntax is,
```bash
find /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/ -type f | xargs -tn1 cat
```
